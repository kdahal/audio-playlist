**How It Works:**
- The `<audio controls autoplay>` element provides built-in play/pause buttons, a progress bar, and volume control.
- JavaScript defines your playlist as an array (edit `files` to match your MP3 names).
- It tracks the current song with `currentIndex`.
- The 'ended' event listener automatically calls `playNext()` when a track finishes, updating the source and playing the next one.
- If you pause manually, resuming will continue from the current track; auto-next only triggers on natural end.

For enhancements (e.g., displaying track names, next/prev buttons, or a visible playlist):
- Add HTML elements like a `<ul>` for track list and buttons for next/prev.
- Extend the JS to update UI (e.g., highlight current track) and add click handlers.
A more advanced version with these features can be found in tutorials like this one, which includes progress bars and volume sliders.<grok-card data-id="d13501" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

### Step 3: Test Locally
- Open `index.html` in a browser (e.g., Chrome) to test. It should auto-play the first track, with play/pause controls. When a song ends, the next starts automatically.
- If audio doesn't load, ensure MP3 paths are correct (relative to the HTML file).

### Step 4: Host It on Your Own Server
Since you don't want other servers, host it yourself. This means running a web server on your computer or a dedicated machine (e.g., old PC or Raspberry Pi). No cloud services needed.

#### Option 1: Local Hosting (For Personal Use on Your Network)
- **Using Python (Built-in on most systems):** Open a terminal/command prompt in your folder and run:


======================================================


- Access at `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
- For network access (e.g., from phone), use your computer's IP (find with `ipconfig` or `ifconfig`) like `http://192.168.1.100:8000`.
- **Using Node.js (If Installed):** Install `http-server` globally (`npm install -g http-server`), then run `http-server` in your folder.

This serves the site and MP3 files from your machine. Stop the server when done.

#### Option 2: Public Hosting on Your Own Hardware
- Set up a full web server like Apache or Nginx on your computer/server (free, open-source).
- Install Apache (e.g., via XAMPP for Windows/Mac, or `sudo apt install apache2` on Linux).
- Place your files in the server's root folder (e.g., `/var/www/html` on Linux).
- Get a domain (optional, from a registrar like Namecheap) and point it to your public IP.
- Forward port 80/443 on your router for internet access (be cautious with security; use HTTPS with free Let's Encrypt certs).
- For a dedicated setup, use a Raspberry Pi as a home serverâ€”install Raspberry Pi OS, set up Nginx, and host locally.

#### Security and Tips
- Only upload your own or licensed MP3s to avoid copyright issues.
- For large playlists, ensure your server has enough storage/bandwidth.
- If streaming to many users, a home setup might be slow; consider upgrading hardware.
- Test cross-browser (Chrome, Firefox work best for HTML5 audio).

This gives you a fully self-contained website. If you need more features like shuffle or search, extend the JS accordingly. For detailed code variations, search for "HTML5 audio playlist JavaScript" tutorials online.
